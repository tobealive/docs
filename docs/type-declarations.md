# Type Declarations


## Function Types

You can use type aliases for naming specific function signatures – for
example:

```v
type Filter = fn (string) string
```

This works like any other type – for example, a function can accept an
argument of a function type:

```v
type Filter = fn (string) string

fn filter(s string, f Filter) string {
	return f(s)
}
```

V has duck-typing, so functions don't need to declare compatibility with
a function type – they just have to be compatible:

```v
fn uppercase(s string) string {
	return s.to_upper()
}

// now `uppercase` can be used everywhere where Filter is expected
```

Compatible functions can also be explicitly cast to a function type:

```v oksyntax
my_filter := Filter(uppercase)
```

The cast here is purely informational – again, duck-typing means that the
resulting type is the same without an explicit cast:

```v oksyntax
my_filter := uppercase
```

You can pass the assigned function as an argument:

```v oksyntax
println(filter('Hello world', my_filter)) // prints `HELLO WORLD`
```

And you could of course have passed it directly as well, without using a
local variable:

```v oksyntax
println(filter('Hello world', uppercase))
```

And this works with anonymous functions as well:

```v oksyntax
println(filter('Hello world', fn (s string) string {
	return s.to_upper()
}))
```

You can see the complete
[example here](https://github.com/vlang/v/tree/master/examples/function_types.v).

## Interfaces

```v
// interface-example.1
struct Dog {
	breed string
}

fn (d Dog) speak() string {
	return 'woof'
}

struct Cat {
	breed string
}

fn (c Cat) speak() string {
	return 'meow'
}

// unlike Go and like TypeScript, V's interfaces can define fields, not just methods.
interface Speaker {
	breed string
	speak() string
}

fn main() {
	dog := Dog{'Leonberger'}
	cat := Cat{'Siamese'}

	mut arr := []Speaker{}
	arr << dog
	arr << cat
	for item in arr {
		println('a ${item.breed} says: ${item.speak()}')
	}
}
```

### Implement an interface

A type implements an interface by implementing its methods and fields.
There is no explicit declaration of intent, no "implements" keyword.

An interface can have a `mut:` section. Implementing types will need
to have a `mut` receiver, for methods declared in the `mut:` section
of an interface.

```v
// interface-example.2
module main

interface Foo {
	write(string) string
}

// => the method signature of a type, implementing interface Foo should be:
// `fn (s Type) write(a string) string`

interface Bar {
mut:
	write(string) string
}

// => the method signature of a type, implementing interface Bar should be:
// `fn (mut s Type) write(a string) string`

struct MyStruct {}

// MyStruct implements the interface Foo, but *not* interface Bar
fn (s MyStruct) write(a string) string {
	return a
}

fn main() {
	s1 := MyStruct{}
	fn1(s1)
	// fn2(s1) -> compile error, since MyStruct does not implement Bar
}

fn fn1(s Foo) {
	println(s.write('Foo'))
}

// fn fn2(s Bar) { // does not match
//      println(s.write('Foo'))
// }
```

### Casting an interface

We can test the underlying type of interface using dynamic cast operators:

```v oksyntax
// interface-exmaple.3 (continued from interface-exampe.1)
interface Something {}

fn announce(s Something) {
	if s is Dog {
		println('a ${s.breed} dog') // `s` is automatically cast to `Dog` (smart cast)
	} else if s is Cat {
		println('a cat speaks ${s.speak()}')
	} else {
		println('something else')
	}
}

fn main() {
	dog := Dog{'Leonberger'}
	cat := Cat{'Siamese'}
	announce(dog)
	announce(cat)
}
```

```v
// interface-example.4
interface IFoo {
	foo()
}

interface IBar {
	bar()
}

// implements only IFoo
struct SFoo {}

fn (sf SFoo) foo() {}

// implements both IFoo and IBar
struct SFooBar {}

fn (sfb SFooBar) foo() {}

fn (sfb SFooBar) bar() {
	dump('This implements IBar')
}

fn main() {
	mut arr := []IFoo{}
	arr << SFoo{}
	arr << SFooBar{}

	for a in arr {
		dump(a)
		// In order to execute instances that implements IBar.
		if a is IBar {
			// a.bar() // Error.
			b := a as IBar
			dump(b)
			b.bar()
		}
	}
}
```

For more information, see [Dynamic casts](#dynamic-casts).

### Interface method definitions

Also unlike Go, an interface can have its own methods, similar to how
structs can have their methods. These 'interface methods' do not have
to be implemented, by structs which implement that interface.
They are just a convenient way to write `i.some_function()` instead of
`some_function(i)`, similar to how struct methods can be looked at, as
a convenience for writing `s.xyz()` instead of `xyz(s)`.

> **Note**
> This feature is NOT a "default implementation" like in C#.

For example, if a struct `cat` is wrapped in an interface `a`, that has
implemented a method with the same name `speak`, as a method implemented by
the struct, and you do `a.speak()`, *only* the interface method is called:

```v
interface Adoptable {}

fn (a Adoptable) speak() string {
	return 'adopt me!'
}

struct Cat {}

fn (c Cat) speak() string {
	return 'meow!'
}

struct Dog {}

fn main() {
	cat := Cat{}
	assert dump(cat.speak()) == 'meow!'
	//
	a := Adoptable(cat)
	assert dump(a.speak()) == 'adopt me!' // call Adoptable's `speak`
	if a is Cat {
		// Inside this `if` however, V knows that `a` is not just any
		// kind of Adoptable, but actually a Cat, so it will use the
		// Cat `speak`, NOT the Adoptable `speak`:
		dump(a.speak()) // meow!
	}
	//
	b := Adoptable(Dog{})
	assert dump(b.speak()) == 'adopt me!' // call Adoptable's `speak`
	// if b is Dog {
	// 	dump(b.speak()) // error: unknown method or field: Dog.speak
	// }
}
```

### Embedded interface

Interfaces support embedding, just like structs:

```v
pub interface Reader {
mut:
	read(mut buf []byte) ?int
}

pub interface Writer {
mut:
	write(buf []byte) ?int
}

// ReaderWriter embeds both Reader and Writer.
// The effect is the same as copy/pasting all of the
// Reader and all of the Writer methods/fields into
// ReaderWriter.
pub interface ReaderWriter {
	Reader
	Writer
}
```

### Dynamic casts

To check whether a sum type instance holds a certain type, use `sum is Type`.
To cast a sum type to one of its variants you can use `sum as Type`:

```v
struct Moon {}

struct Mars {}

struct Venus {}

type World = Mars | Moon | Venus

fn (m Mars) dust_storm() bool {
	return true
}

fn main() {
	mut w := World(Moon{})
	assert w is Moon
	w = Mars{}
	// use `as` to access the Mars instance
	mars := w as Mars
	if mars.dust_storm() {
		println('bad weather!')
	}
}
```

`as` will panic if `w` doesn't hold a `Mars` instance.
A safer way is to use a smart cast.

### Smart casting

```v oksyntax
if w is Mars {
	assert typeof(w).name == 'Mars'
	if w.dust_storm() {
		println('bad weather!')
	}
}
```

`w` has type `Mars` inside the body of the `if` statement. This is
known as *flow-sensitive typing*.
If `w` is a mutable identifier, it would be unsafe if the compiler smart casts it without a warning.
That's why you have to declare a `mut` before the `is` expression:

```v ignore
if mut w is Mars {
	assert typeof(w).name == 'Mars'
	if w.dust_storm() {
		println('bad weather!')
	}
}
```

Otherwise `w` would keep its original type.
> This works for both, simple variables and complex expressions like `user.name`

### Matching sum types

You can also use `match` to determine the variant:

```v
struct Moon {}

struct Mars {}

struct Venus {}

type World = Mars | Moon | Venus

fn open_parachutes(n int) {
	println(n)
}

fn land(w World) {
	match w {
		Moon {} // no atmosphere
		Mars {
			// light atmosphere
			open_parachutes(3)
		}
		Venus {
			// heavy atmosphere
			open_parachutes(1)
		}
	}
}
```

`match` must have a pattern for each variant or have an `else` branch.

```v ignore
struct Moon {}
struct Mars {}
struct Venus {}

type World = Moon | Mars | Venus

fn (m Moon) moon_walk() {}
fn (m Mars) shiver() {}
fn (v Venus) sweat() {}

fn pass_time(w World) {
    match w {
        // using the shadowed match variable, in this case `w` (smart cast)
        Moon { w.moon_walk() }
        Mars { w.shiver() }
        else {}
    }
}
```

## Option/Result types and error handling

Option types are for types which may represent `none`. Result types may
represent an error returned from a function.

`Option` types are declared by prepending `?` to the type name: `?Type`.
`Result` types use `!`: `!Type`.

```v
struct User {
	id   int
	name string
}

struct Repo {
	users []User
}

fn (r Repo) find_user_by_id(id int) !User {
	for user in r.users {
		if user.id == id {
			// V automatically wraps this into a result or option type
			return user
		}
	}
	return error('User ${id} not found')
}

// A version of the function using an option
fn (r Repo) find_user_by_id2(id int) ?User {
	for user in r.users {
		if user.id == id {
			return user
		}
	}
	return none
}

fn main() {
	repo := Repo{
		users: [User{1, 'Andrew'}, User{2, 'Bob'}, User{10, 'Charles'}]
	}
	user := repo.find_user_by_id(10) or { // Option/Result types must be handled by `or` blocks
		println(err)
		return
	}
	println(user.id) // "10"
	println(user.name) // "Charles"

	user2 := repo.find_user_by_id2(10) or { return }
}
```

V used to combine `Option` and `Result` into one type, now they are separate.

The amount of work required to "upgrade" a function to an option/result function is minimal;
you have to add a `?` or `!` to the return type and return an error when something goes wrong.

This is the primary mechanism for error handling in V. They are still values, like in Go,
but the advantage is that errors can't be unhandled, and handling them is a lot less verbose.
Unlike other languages, V does not handle exceptions with `throw/try/catch` blocks.

`err` is defined inside an `or` block and is set to the string message passed
to the `error()` function.

```v oksyntax
user := repo.find_user_by_id(7) or {
	println(err) // "User 7 not found"
	return
}
```

### Handling options/results

There are four ways of handling an option/result. The first method is to
propagate the error:

```v
import net.http

fn f(url string) !string {
	resp := http.get(url)!
	return resp.body
}
```

`http.get` returns `!http.Response`. Because `!` follows the call, the
error will be propagated to the caller of `f`. When using `?` after a
function call producing an option, the enclosing function must return
an option as well. If error propagation is used in the `main()`
function it will `panic` instead, since the error cannot be propagated
any further.

The body of `f` is essentially a condensed version of:

```v ignore
    resp := http.get(url) or { return err }
    return resp.body
```

---
The second method is to break from execution early:

```v oksyntax
user := repo.find_user_by_id(7) or { return }
```

Here, you can either call `panic()` or `exit()`, which will stop the execution of the
entire program, or use a control flow statement (`return`, `break`, `continue`, etc)
to break from the current block.

> **Note**
> `break` and `continue` can only be used inside a `for` loop.

V does not have a way to forcibly "unwrap" an option (as other languages do,
for instance Rust's `unwrap()` or Swift's `!`). To do this, use `or { panic(err) }` instead.

---
The third method is to provide a default value at the end of the `or` block.
In case of an error, that value would be assigned instead,
so it must have the same type as the content of the `Option` being handled.

```v
fn do_something(s string) !string {
	if s == 'foo' {
		return 'foo'
	}
	return error('invalid string')
}

a := do_something('foo') or { 'default' } // a will be 'foo'
b := do_something('bar') or { 'default' } // b will be 'default'
println(a)
println(b)
```

---
The fourth method is to use `if` unwrapping:

```v
import net.http

if resp := http.get('https://google.com') {
	println(resp.body) // resp is a http.Response, not an option
} else {
	println(err)
}
```

Above, `http.get` returns a `!http.Response`. `resp` is only in scope for the first
`if` branch. `err` is only in scope for the `else` branch.

## Custom error types

V gives you the ability to define custom error types through the `IError` interface.
The interface requires two methods: `msg() string` and `code() int`. Every type that
implements these methods can be used as an error.

When defining a custom error type it is recommended to embed the builtin `Error` default
implementation. This provides an empty default implementation for both required methods,
so you only have to implement what you really need, and may provide additional utility
functions in the future.

```v
struct PathError {
	Error
	path string
}

fn (err PathError) msg() string {
	return 'Failed to open path: ${err.path}'
}

fn try_open(path string) ? {
	return IError(PathError{
		path: path
	})
}

fn main() {
	try_open('/tmp') or { panic(err) }
}
```

## Generics

```v wip

struct Repo[T] {
    db DB
}

struct User {
	id   int
	name string
}

struct Post {
	id   int
	user_id int
	title string
	body string
}

fn new_repo[T](db DB) Repo[T] {
    return Repo[T]{db: db}
}

// This is a generic function. V will generate it for every type it's used with.
fn (r Repo[T]) find_by_id(id int) ?T {
    table_name := T.name // in this example getting the name of the type gives us the table name
    return r.db.query_one[T]('select * from ${table_name} where id = ?', id)
}

db := new_db()
users_repo := new_repo[User](db) // returns Repo[User]
posts_repo := new_repo[Post](db) // returns Repo[Post]
user := users_repo.find_by_id(1)? // find_by_id[User]
post := posts_repo.find_by_id(1)? // find_by_id[Post]
```

Currently generic function definitions must declare their type parameters, but in
future V will infer generic type parameters from single-letter type names in
runtime parameter types. This is why `find_by_id` can omit `[T]`, because the
receiver argument `r` uses a generic type `T`.

Another example:

```v
fn compare[T](a T, b T) int {
	if a < b {
		return -1
	}
	if a > b {
		return 1
	}
	return 0
}

// compare[int]
println(compare(1, 0)) // Outputs: 1
println(compare(1, 1)) //          0
println(compare(1, 2)) //         -1
// compare[string]
println(compare('1', '0')) // Outputs: 1
println(compare('1', '1')) //          0
println(compare('1', '2')) //         -1
// compare[f64]
println(compare(1.1, 1.0)) // Outputs: 1
println(compare(1.1, 1.1)) //          0
println(compare(1.1, 1.2)) //         -1
```
